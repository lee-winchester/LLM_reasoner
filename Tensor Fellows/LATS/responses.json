            "lats_llama": "It seems like you're trying to analyze a plan for rearranging blocks under certain rules.\n\nLet's break down your initial plan and statement:\n\n**Initial Plan:**\n\n1. Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block\n2. Put down the blue block\n3. Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block\n4. Put down the orange block\n5. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block\n6. Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block\n7. Pick up the red block\n8. Stack the red block on top of the orange block\n9. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block\n10. Stack the yellow block on top of the red block\n\n**Initial Conditions and Goal:**\n\n* Initially, the red block is on top of the blue block.\n* The goal is to have the red block on top of the orange block and the yellow block on top of the red block.\n\nYour plan seems valid according to the given rules. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. Unstacking the blue block from on top of the orange block: Valid, as it's clear and on top.\n2. Putting down the blue block: Invalid, since putting down a block makes your hand empty, but you're not holding anything to put down. This seems like an error in your plan.\n\nThis error might affect the rest of the plan. Would you like me to continue analyzing or provide suggestions for corrections?",
            "lats_gemini": "Your plan needs to be detailed to ensure it adheres to the rules.  Here's a structured approach to planning how to achieve your goal, filling in the steps you'll need to take.\n\n**Initial State:**\n\n* Hand: Empty\n* Table: Blue block\n* Blue block: Orange block\n* Orange block: Red block\n* Red block: Yellow block\n* Yellow block: Clear\n\n**Goal State:**\n\n* Red block: Blue block\n* Yellow block: Orange block\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. **Pick up the yellow block:**  (Hand is empty, Yellow block is clear)\n2. **Put down the yellow block:** (Hand is not empty)\n3. **Unstack the red block from the orange block:** (Hand is empty, Red block is clear)\n4. **Stack the red block on the blue block:** (Hand is not empty, Blue block is clear)\n5. **Pick up the orange block:** (Hand is empty, Orange block is clear)\n6. **Stack the orange block on the table:** (Hand is not empty, Table is always clear)\n7. **Pick up the yellow block:** (Hand is empty, Yellow block is clear)\n8. **Stack the yellow block on the orange block:** (Hand is not empty, Orange block is clear)\n\n**Verification:**\n\nThis plan successfully achieves the goal state.  Each step is explicitly justified against the rules provided.  Remember,  any other plan must explicitly follow the rules in the same way.  Incorrect plans will fail because they violate one or more of the rules.",
