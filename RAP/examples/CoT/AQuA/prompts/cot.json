    "Q: A class of 35 students has an average height of 180 cm. Seven students whose average height is 120 cm, left the class and seven others whose average height is 140 cm, joined. Calculate the new average height of the students of the class (in cm) is? Options: A)204.6 cm, B)404.6 cm, C)224.6 cm, D)184.0 cm, E)256.6 cm\n\nA: The total height of students before seven students left is 180 * 35 = 6300 cm.The total height of students who joined is 140 * 7  = 980 cm. The new total height of students after seven students joined is 6300 - 840 + 980 = 6440 cm. The new average height is 6440 / 35 = 184 cm. The answer is D.\n\n",

    "Q: How much is 70% of 40 is greater than 4/5 of 25?, options: A)22, B)67, C)88, D)12, E)8\n\nA: 70% of 40 is 40 * 0.7 = 28. 4/5 of 25 is 25 * 4/5 = 20. 70% of 40 is greater than 4/5 of 25 by 28 - 20 = 8. The answer is E.\n\n",

    "Q: What is the average of the first 21 multiples of 7?, options: A)22, B)77, C)88, D)21, E)65\n\nA: The sum of the first 21 multiples of 7 is 7 * (1+2+â€¦.+21). After simplification, 7 * ((21x22) / 2) = 1617. The average of the first 21 multiples of 7 is 1617 / 21 = 77. The answer is B.\n\n",

    "Q: In a certain store, the profit is 320% of the cost. If the cost increases by 25% but the selling price remains constant, approximately what percentage of the selling price is the profit?, options: A)80%, B)70%, C)60%, D)50%, E)40%\n\nA:  Let cost be 100. The profit is 100 * 3.2 = 320. The selling price is 100 + 320 = 420. The new cost is 100 * 0.25 + 100 = 125. The new profit is 420 - 125 = 295. The percentage is 296/420 * 100 = 70%. The answer is B.\n\n",

    "Q: A 290 meters long train running at the speed of 120 kmph crosses another train running in opposite direction at the speed of 80 kmph in 9 seconds. What is the length of the other train?, options: A)230 m, B)210 m, C)260 m, D)320 m, E)330 m\n\nA: The relative speed is 120 + 80 = 200 kmph. The speed in m/s is 200 kmph = (200 * 1000)/3600m/s = 55.55m/s. The distance is 55.55m/s * 9 = 499.95m. The length of the other train is 499.95 - 290 = 209.95. The answer is B.\n\n",

    "Q: A train ,140 meters long, travels at a speed of 45 km/hr and crosses a bridge in 30 seconds. The length of the bridge is, options: A)270 m, B)245 m, C)235 m, D)220 m, E)240 m\n\nA: The speed in m/s is 45 km/hr = (45 * 1000)/3600 m/s = 12.5 m/s. The total distance traveled is 12.5 m/s * 30 s = 375 m. The length of the bridge is 375 m - 140 m = 235 m. The answer is C.\n\n",

    "Q: A coin is tossed three times. What is the probability that there is at the least one tail?, options: A)7/8, B)6/7, C)1/7, D)3/7, E)1/31\n\nA: The probability of getting all heads is (1/2)^3 = 1/8. The probability of at least one tail is 1 - 1/8 = 7/8. The answer is A.\n\n",

    "Q: 10 men, working 3 hours a day can complete a work in 18 days. How many hours a day must 15 men work to complete the work in 12 days ? options: A)3 hours a day, B)5 hours a day, C)6 hours a day, D)7 hours a day, E)8 hours a day\n\nA: The total man-hours needed to complete the work is 10 * 3 * 18 = 540. The hours needed to complete the work in 12 days are 540 / (15 * 12) = 540 / 180 = 3. The answer is A.\n\n",

    "Q: When 20 percent of a number is added to another number the second number increases to 140 per cent. What is the ratio between the first and the second number? options: A)3 : 4, B)2 : 1, C)3 : 2, D)Data inadequate, E)None of these\n\nA: Let the first number be x and the second number be y. The equation satisfied the increase is y + 0.2 x = 1.4y. The ratio between the first and the second number is y = 0.5x. The answer is B.",

    "Q: An electric pump can fill a tank in 7 hours. Because of a leak in the tank, it took 14 hours to fill the tank. If the tank is full, how much time will the leak take to empty it?, options: A)10 hours, B)12 hours, C)8 hours, D)5 hours, E)14 hours\n\nA: The filling rate of the pump without leak is 1/7. The filling rate of the pump with leak is 1/14. The leaking rate is 1/7 - 1/14 = 1/14. So it takes 14 hours to empty it. The answer is E."
