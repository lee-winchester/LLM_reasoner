        "Four years ago, Kody was only half as old as Mohamed. If Mohamed is currently twice 30 years old, how old is Kody?\n\nQ: How old was Mohamed four years ago?\nA: We were told that Mohamed is currently twice 30 years old, so he is currently 30 * 2 = 60 years old. That means that four years ago he must have been 60 - 4 = 56 years old. The answer is 56.\n\nQ: How old is Kody?\nA: Four years ago, Kody was half as old as Mohamed, so Kody must have been 56 / 2 = 28 years old then.

The answer is 5.\n\nQ: How old is Pam now?\nA: If Pam is currently twice as young as Rena, that means that Rena is currently twice as old as Pam is. So if P stands for Pam's age now and R stands for Rena's age now, then we know that R = 2 * P And since Rena is 5 years older than Pam now, we know that R = P + 5. By substitution, we have P + 5 = 2 * P, which means that P = 5. The answer is 5.\n\n",
