# CSE 576, 2024 Fall class project
Class project for CSE 576, NLP, Fall 2024. The topic is building and optimizing LLM-based world models for reasoning and planning tasks. 


Model to be used: Llama-3.1-8B-instruct

RAP:  https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14992
LATS: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04406
Refer to algorithm implementations that would be in the github repos mentioned in the papers. 

## Week 1 (30th October, 2024 - November 6, 2024): (For Both Tensor Fellows and LLM Parrots)
1. Start implementing RAP and LATs algorithms.
2. Run Zero-shot as one of the baseline.
3. Task on which RAP and LATS are to be evaluated: Plan generation for BlocksWorld Domain.
