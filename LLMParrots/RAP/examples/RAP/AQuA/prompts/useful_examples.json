  "input": "Given a question and some sub-questions, determine whether the last sub-question is useful to answer the question. Output 'Yes' or 'No', and a reason.\n\nQuestion 1: John found that the average of 15 numbers is 40. If 10 is added to each number then the mean of the numbers is? Options: A) 50, B) 45, C) 65, D) 78, E) 64.\nQuestion 1.1: What is the total sum of the 15 numbers? \nQuestion 1.2: How much will the sum increase when 10 is added to each number? \nNew question 1.3: What is the new total sum after addition?\nIs the new question useful? Yes. The final mean can be calculated from the total sum after addition.\n\nQuestion 2: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a. Options: A) 1/2, B) 3/2, C) 5/2, D) 4/2, E) 7/2.\nQuestion 2.1: How can we express b in terms of a? \nAnswer 2.1: We can express b as b = 4a/3. The answer is b = 4a/3.\nQuestion 2.2: What is the second equation when substituting b with a? \nAnswer 2.2: Substituting b = 4a/3 into 8a + 5b = 22, we get: 8a + 5 * (4a/3) = 22, simplifying further: 44a/3 =22. The answer is 44a/3 = 22.\nNew Question 2.3: How can we express a in terms of b? Is the new question useful? No. This is a duplicate question because we have already replaced b with a.\n\nQuestion 3: If q is the square of a positive integer, which of the following must be equal to the square of the next positive integer? Options: A) √n + 1, B) n + 1, C) n^2 + 1, D) q + 2√q + 1, E)n^2 + 2n + 1.\nNew question 3.1: What is the number of the integer? \nIs the new question useful? No. This question is not answerable nor relavent to the main question.\n\nQuestion 4: A train, 140 meters long, travels at a speed of 45 km/hr and crosses a bridge in 30 seconds. The length of the bridge is? Options: A)270 m, B)245 m, C)235 m, D)220 m, E)240 m\nQuestion 4.1: What is the speed in m/s?\nAnswer 4.1: 45 km/hr = (45 * 1000)/3600 m/s = 12.5 m/s. The answer is 12.5 m/s.\nNew question 4.2: What is the total distance traveled?\nIs the new question useful? Yes. The total distance is the sum of the length of the bridge and the train, so it is helpful to calculate the bridge length later.",
