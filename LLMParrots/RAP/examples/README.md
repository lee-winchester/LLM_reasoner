# Examples of using LLM Reasoners
LLM Reasoners now provides the example code for the following methods:
  - [Reasoning-via-Planning, MCTS](RAP) ([Hao et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14992))
  - [Chain-of-thoughts](CoT) ([Wei et al., 202](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903))
  - [Tree-of-Thoughts, BFS](ToT) ([Yao et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601))
  - [Tree-of-Thoughts, DFS](ToT) ([Yao et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601))

For each reasoning method, we provide scripts for blocksworld dataset tasks.

## How to run the examples
You can find the README about how to run the code under each directory with `cd examples/reasoning_method/dataset`.
